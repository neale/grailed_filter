# Grailed Feed Filter by Keyword

Chrome extension to remove listings from view with matching keywords

I used this initially to filter out Essentials clothing from Fear of God listings since Grailed does not offer this functionality

# Usage

Clone repo and load as chrome extension:

* Edit `content.js` to contain the keywords that you want to filter
* Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/
* Enable "Developer mode" at the top right
* Click "Load unpacked" and select your extension's folder

Done. Try it out.
